# Professor Sample

In the process of learning how to code in Python one of the assignments that I had was to recreate the program that works inside a little old toy called “Little Professor”, and so I decided to make my own work on top of that assignment making some changes and improvements here and there.

Therefore, this program is a game that helps people, actually kids, to train their math skills. It’s a 10 problems Quiz game that uses Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division. Since it is meant for kids, especially the level 1, the subtraction problems will never have as answer negative numbers, and the divisions answers will never have decimal numbers either.

Every problem has three opportunities to be answered correctly, after that the program will prompt the correct answer for the user. The program handles incorrect answers case-insensitive (numbers, letters, etc.). The game counts with three levels, each level represents the amount of digits meant to be used in the problems, e.g. Level 1 is for “x + y”, level 2 is for “xx + yy”, and level 3 is for “xxx + yyy”. This is just raw code and I'm still working on it since I'm still learning, however, I'll leave it here to see if this can help others.

In order to try it out you will need to have (obviously) Python installed on your machine and also the Random module within, then just run it through the terminal and that’s it.
